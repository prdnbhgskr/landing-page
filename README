# Mock-Up Travel Agency Landing Page

This project is a practice website created using the knowledge I have gained from The Odin Project so far. The website is built using HTML and CSS and serves as the landing page for a mock-up travel agency specializing in travel experiences in the Netherlands.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to apply and demonstrate my skills in web development, focusing on creating a visually appealing and functional landing page. The website features various sections, including a header with navigation links, a hero section with a punchline and description, and a "Voyager's Voices" section showcasing traveler testimonies through images and captions.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Flexbox Layout**: Used extensively to create flexible and responsive layouts.
- **Image Gallery**: A section displaying images with captions to highlight traveler experiences.
- **Call to Action**: A prominent sign-up button encouraging visitors to join the travel agency's adventures.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
